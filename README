This is a version of a web application created to help a small rural community share vehicles and rides.  People planning trips post their "trips" here so others can know about the trip and potentially share a ride.  

Common destinations are assigned colors.  Calendar days with trips happening are colored with the colors for those destinations (up to eight).  Less common destinations are all assigned the same color.

Clicking the "Show Only Trips to" items changes the calendar so only trips to that destination is shown.  

The WIP view is planned to be helpful during the meetings where actual vehicle assignments for the trips are made.  

Rake tasks are setup to generate the numerous color images and css classes need to provide all possible permutations of different destinations on a given day.

Developed using BDD methodology with rSpec.

Current progress:
  Mostly functional.  Some jQuery/ javascript stuff added.  Month calendar now has tooltips on days, new trip has a date picker, and the WIP has a sideways accordion.  Still plenty of rough edges and work to do.ds

  When trying to start this app for the first time first do:
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

    and if you want to run tests...
    rake db:test:prepare
    
    to load some fake data...
    rake create_trips
